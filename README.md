Bootcamp Second Homework Assignment

## Project Description 
This assignment consists developing an employeer ready portfolio that showcases the work that I have completed for emplyement consideration. Because I have a background in marketing and I am hopign to blend the two fields post bootcamp, I am showcasing a handful of ads that I have recently developed as well as leaving a filler image for the next project I will complete. 

This process consisted of coding a responsive website with semantic code that is up to best practice.
